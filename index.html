    <h2>Misa Amane (Japanese: 弥海砂 Amane Misa) is the heroine of the manga, anime series and films Death Note. A well-known fashion model who won the “Readers' Choice” competition in “18” magazine. Based on the film, she is a popular TV presenter. Few would recognize her as the killer who caused a commotion at the Sakura TV studio, the second Kira. Grateful to Kira for punishing her parents' killer, she is willing to do anything to find him. Having fallen in love with Light Yagami, she makes a deal with the god of death twice in order to obtain the Eyes of the God of Death and be useful to him. He often refers to himself in the third person, calling himself "Misa-Misa".</h2>

    <h1>Meeting with Light Yagami</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>In the anime and manga: In this entry, she calls herself Kira, however L immediately detects changes in Kira's abilities (the new Kira can kill without knowing the name). The detectives compose a false message from Kira (in fact, this message is composed by Yagami Light, so it is not completely false), which Misa willingly believes. Misa makes another video in which she confesses that she is the second Kira and invites the first Kira to meet her. She sends a diary to Sakura TV, in which the meeting place is encrypted - Aoyama, the Note Blue club. Light goes there under the pretext of investigating.</h2>

        <h1>Relationship with Light Yagami</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>Seeing Light, Misa immediately recognized him as Kira: her eyes of the God of Death allow her to see the life expectancy only of those people who do not own the Death Note. Without thinking twice, she finds Light's address on the Internet and comes to his home. Further, it is no longer clear who she loves more: Light - because he is Kira, or Kira - because Light personifies him. Having lost her memory after her arrest, Misa continued to love Light with the same intensity. L used this to convince Misa to catch the third Kira.

        After L's death, Light and Misa began living together. Misa was happy that she could help Light build a new world. Light eventually promised to marry her. But when Misa stopped owning the notebook, Light sharply lost interest in her. To further the investigation into Kira's case, Light began dating Kiyomi Takada.
        
        Even though Misa is madly in love with Light, he is quite cold towards her. Perhaps Light Yagami never had any sympathy for Misa and only used her as a tool in the fight against Kira's pursuers.
        
        But it’s worth noting that Light treated Misa this way only when he was Kira. After abandoning the Notebook, and due to memory loss, Light became softer towards Amane, he did not agree to L’s proposal to take advantage of the girl’s feelings for the sake of investigation, and Light also did not want to put her in danger, he was even worried about her, considering himself responsible for her falling in love with him girl, although he did not like Misa's advances.
        
        But after receiving the Notebook and returning his memory, Light began to manipulate Misa again.</h2>
